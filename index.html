        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small andlight weight language allowing maximum flexability for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server) it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provideprogramatic control over them</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript varables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span></li>
          <li><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignments operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can no have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x = 10;</span></li>
          <li><span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding', 2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name; 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
          <li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actijons for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is ture, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
          <li><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
          <li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of code block. When we call our function this will run the code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting togheter a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs into a table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finish our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lest call our function over and over again.</li>
